Firmware that powers my IoT Smart Switch project. Currently supports only ATmega168P ÂµC (_and probably all of the other MCUs from this series_).



## About the project

My idea is to design a smart device that provides power sensing and wireless control. Starting with a more simplistic design of a wall switch.

### Schematics

The project is currently under heavy development and because of that, all of the schematics and board layouts are private. I want to make sure, that I release a quite good design for the public _and probably to hide my stupid mistakes that I made_ :)

### Hardware

First and second iterations of the mainboard features an ATmega168P MCU with a nRF24L01+ wireless module. Current sensing is done using the hall-effect ACS724 chip (_10 ampere version_), but for the most part those things are subject to change.



## Why? 

Why not? I'm curious about all the technology that surrounds us and just to learn new stuff. :smile:
